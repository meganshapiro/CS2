THESEUS
Now  fair Hippolyta  our nuptial hour
Draws apace  four happy days bring in
Another moon    methinks  slow
This old moon wanes  lingers desires 
Like step-dame dowager 
Long withering out young man's revenue 

HIPPOLYTA
Four days quickly steep themselves nights 
Four nights quickly dream away time 
And moon  silver bow
New bent heaven  behold night
Of our solemnities 

THESEUS

Awake pert nimble spirit mirth 
Turn melancholy forth funerals

EGEUS
Happy Theseus  our renowned duke 

THESEUS
Thanks  good Egeus  what's news 

EGEUS
Full vexation come  complaint
Against child  daughter Hermia  
Stand forth  Demetrius  noble lord 
This man hath consent marry  
Stand forth  Lysander   gracious duke 
This man hath bewitch'd bosom child 
Thou   Lysander  hast given rhymes 
And interchang'd love-tokens child 
Thou hast moonlight at window sung 
With feigning voice  verses feigning love 
And stol'n impression fantasy
With bracelets hair  rings  gawds  conceits 
Knacks  trifles  nosegays  sweetmeats  messengers
Of strong prevailment unharden'd youth  
With cunning hast filch'd daughter's heart 
Turned obedience  which due 
To stubborn harshness   gracious duke 
Be here before grace
Consent marry Demetrius 
I beg ancient privilege Athens  
As mine may dispose 
Which either gentleman
Or death  according our law
Immediately provided case 

THESEUS
What say  Hermia  advis'd  fair maid 
To father should god 
One compos'd beauties  yea  one
To whom form wax 
By him imprinted  within power
To leave figure  disfigure 
Demetrius worthy gentleman 

HERMIA
So Lysander 

THESEUS
                himself 
But  kind  wanting father's voice 
The other must held worthier 

HERMIA
I would father look'd eyes 

THESEUS
Rather eyes must judgment look 

HERMIA
I entreat grace pardon 
I know power made bold 
Nor may concern modesty
In presence here plead thoughts 
But beseech grace may know
The worst may befall case
If refuse wed Demetrius 

THESEUS
Either die death  abjure
For ever society men 
Therefore  fair Hermia  question desires 
Know youth  examine blood 
Whether  yield father's choice 
You can endure livery nun 
For aye shady cloister mew'd 
To live barren sister life 
Chanting faint hymns cold  fruitless moon 
Thrice-blessed master blood
To undergo maiden pilgrimage 
But earthlier happy rose distill'd
Than which  withering virgin thorn 
Grows  lives  dies  single blessedness 

HERMIA
So grow  live  die  lord 
Ere yield virgin patent up
Unto lordship  whose unwished yoke
My soul consents give sovereignty 

THESEUS
Take time pause  next new moon  
The sealing-day betwixt love me
For everlasting bond fellowship  
Upon day either prepare die
For disobedience father's 
Or else wed Demetrius  would 
Or Diana's altar protest
For aye austerity single life 

DEMETRIUS
Relent  sweet Hermia   Lysander  yield
Thy crazed title certain right 

LYSANDER
You father's love  Demetrius 
Let Hermia's  marry him 

EGEUS
Scornful Lysander  true  hath love 
And mine love render him 
And mine  right her
I estate unto Demetrius 

LYSANDER
I  lord  deriv'd 
As possess'd  love more than 
My fortunes every way fairly rank'd 
If vantage  Demetrius's 
And  which more than these boasts can 
I belov'd beauteous Hermia 
Why should prosecute right 
Demetrius  avouch head 
Made love Nedar's daughter  Helena 
And won soul   sweet lady  dotes 
Devoutly dotes  dotes idolatry 
Upon spotted inconstant man 

THESEUS
I must confess heard much 
And Demetrius thought spoke thereof 
But  being over-full self-affairs 
My mind lose   Demetrius  come 
And come  Egeus  
I some private schooling both  
For  fair Hermia  look arm yourself
To fit fancies father's 
Or else law Athens yields  
Which means may extenuate  
To death  vow single life  
Come  Hippolyta  cheer  love 
Demetrius  Egeus  along 
I must employ some business
Against our nuptial  confer you
Of something nearly concerns yourselves 

EGEUS
With duty desire follow 

 Exeunt THESEUS  HIPPOLYTA  EGEUS  DEMETRIUS  Train  

LYSANDER
How  love  cheek pale 
How chance roses there fade fast 

HERMIA
Belike want rain  which could well
Beteem tempest eyes 

LYSANDER
Ah  aught could ever read 
Could ever hear tale history 
The course true love never run smooth 
But either was different blood  

HERMIA
O cross  Too high enthrall'd low 

LYSANDER
Or else misgraffed respect years  

HERMIA
O spite  Too old engag'd young 

LYSANDER
Or else stood upon choice friends 

HERMIA
O hell  choose love another's eye 

LYSANDER
Or  there were sympathy choice 
War  death  sickness  lay siege 
Making momentary sound 
Swift shadow  short any dream 
Brief lightning collied night
That  spleen  unfolds both heaven earth 
And ere man hath power say  Behold 
The jaws darkness devour 
So quick bright things come confusion 

HERMIA
If true lovers ever cross'd 
It stands edict destiny 
Then teach our trial patience 
Because customary cross 
As due love thoughts  dreams  sighs 
Wishes tears  poor fancy's followers 

LYSANDER
A good persuasion  therefore  hear  Hermia 
I widow aunt  dowager
Of great revenue  hath child 
From Athens house remote seven leagues 
And respects only son 
There  gentle Hermia  may marry 
And place sharp Athenian law
Cannot pursue  lovest 
Steal forth father's house tomorrow night 
And wood  league without town 
Where meet once Helena 
To observance morn May 
There stay 

HERMIA
                            good Lysander 
I swear Cupid's strongest bow 
By best arrow  golden head 
By simplicity Venus' doves 
By which knitteth souls prospers loves 
And fire which burn'd Carthage queen 
When false Trojan under sail was seen  
By vows ever men broke 
In number more than ever women spoke  
In same place hast appointed 
Tomorrow truly meet 

LYSANDER
Keep promise  love  Look  here comes Helena 

 Enter HELENA  

HERMIA
God speed fair Helena  Whither away 

HELENA
Call fair  fair again unsay 
Demetrius loves fair  happy fair 
Your eyes lode-stars  tongue's sweet air
More tuneable than lark shepherd's ear 
When wheat green  when hawthorn buds appear 
Sickness catching   were favour 
Yours would catch  fair Hermia  ere 
My ear should catch voice  eye eye 
My tongue should catch tongue's sweet melody 
Were world mine  Demetrius being bated 
The rest I'd give translated 
O  teach look  art
You sway motion Demetrius' heart 

HERMIA
I frown upon him  loves still 

HELENA
O frowns would teach smiles skill 

HERMIA
I give him curses  gives love 

HELENA
O prayers could affection move 

HERMIA
The more hate  more follows 

HELENA
The more love  more hateth 

HERMIA
His folly  Helena  fault mine 

HELENA
None  beauty  would fault were mine 

HERMIA
Take comfort  more see face 
Lysander myself fly place  
Before time Lysander see 
Seem'd Athens paradise 
O   graces love dwell 
That hath turn'd heaven unto hell 

LYSANDER
Helen  our minds unfold 
To-morrow night  when Phoebe doth behold
Her silver visage watery glass 
Decking liquid pearl bladed grass  
A time lovers' flights doth still conceal  
Through Athens' gates devis'd steal 

HERMIA
And wood where often I
Upon faint primrose beds were wont lie 
Emptying our bosoms counsel sweet 
There Lysander myself meet 
And thence Athens turn away our eyes 
To seek new friends stranger companies 
Farewell  sweet playfellow  pray 
And good luck grant Demetrius  
Keep word  Lysander  must starve our sight
From lovers' food  till morrow deep midnight 

LYSANDER
I  Hermia 

 Exit HERMIA  

LYSANDER
                   Helena  adieu 
As him  Demetrius dote 

 Exit LYSANDER  

HELENA
How happy some o'er other some can 
Through Athens thought fair 
But  Demetrius thinks 
He know know 
And errs  doting Hermia's eyes 
So  admiring qualities 
Things base vile  holding quantity 
Love can transpose form dignity 
Love looks eyes  mind 
And therefore wing'd Cupid painted blind 
Nor hath love's mind any judgment taste 
Wings eyes figure unheedy haste 
And therefore love said child 
Because choice oft beguil'd 
As waggish boys game themselves forswear 
So boy Love perjur'd everywhere 
For ere Demetrius look'd Hermia's eyne 
He hail'd down oaths was only mine 
And when hail some heat Hermia felt 
So dissolv'd  showers oaths melt 
I tell him fair Hermia's flight 
Then wood to-morrow night
Pursue  intelligence
If thanks  dear expense 
But herein mean enrich pain 
To sight thither back again 

 Exit HELENA

    gold coats spots see

And hang pearl every cowslip's ear 
Farewell  lob spirits  gone

PUCK
The king doth keep revels here to-night 
Take heed Queen come within sight 
For Oberon passing fell wrath 
Because  attendant  hath
A lovely boy  stol'n Indian king 
She never had sweet changeling 
And jealous Oberon would child
Knight train  trace forests wild 
But perforce withholds loved boy 
Crowns him flowers  makes him joy 
And never meet grove green 
By fountain clear  spangled starlight sheen 
But square  elves fear
Creep into acorn cups  hide there 

FAIRY
Either mistake shape making quite 
Or else shrewd knavish sprite
Call'd Robin Goodfellow  he
That frights maidens villagery 
Skim milk  sometimes labour quern 
And bootless make breathless housewife churn 
And sometime make drink bear barm 
Mislead night-wanderers  laughing at harm 
Those Hobgoblin call  sweet Puck 
You work  good luck

                speak'st aright 
I merry wanderer night 
I jest Oberon  make him smile 
When fat bean-fed horse beguile 
Neighing likeness filly foal 
And sometime lurk gossip's bowl 
In very likeness roasted crab 
And  when drinks  against lips bob 
And withered dewlap pour ale 
The wisest aunt  telling saddest tale 
Sometime three-foot stool mistaketh 
Then slip bum  down topples 
And 'tailor' cries  falls into cough 
And whole quire hold hips loffe 
And waxen mirth  neeze  swear
A merrier hour was never wasted there

When hast stol'n away fairy-land 
And shape Corin sat day 
Playing pipes corn  versing love
To amorous Phillida  art here 
Come farthest steep India 
But  forsooth  bouncing Amazon 
Your buskin'd mistress warrior love 
To Theseus must wedded  come
To give bed joy prosperity 

OBERON
How canst  shame  Titania 
Glance at credit Hippolyta 
Knowing know love Theseus 
Didst lead him through glimmering night
From Perigenia  whom ravish'd 
And make him fair Aegle break faith 
With Ariadne Antiopa 

TITANIA
These forgeries jealousy 
And never  since middle summer's spring 
Met hill  dale  forest  mead 
By paved fountain  rushy brook 
Or beached margent sea 
To dance our ringlets whistling wind 
But brawls hast disturb'd our sport 
Therefore winds  piping vain 
As revenge  suck'd sea
Contagious fogs  which  falling land 
Hath every pelting river made proud
That overborne continents 
The ox hath therefore stretch'd yoke vain 
The ploughman lost sweat  green corn
Hath rotted ere youth attain'd beard 
The fold stands empty drowned field 
And crows fatted murrion flock 
The nine men's morris fill'd mud 
And quaint mazes wanton green 
For lack tread  undistinguishable 
The human mortals want winter here 
No night hymn carol blest  
Therefore moon  governess floods 
Pale anger  washes air 
That rheumatic diseases abound 
And thorough distemperature see
The seasons alter  hoary-headed frosts
Fall fresh lap crimson rose 
And old Hyem's thin icy crown
An odorous chaplet sweet summer buds
Is  mockery  set  spring  summer 
The childing autumn  angry winter  change
Their wonted liveries  maz'd world 
By increase  knows which which 
And same progeny evils comes
From our debate  our dissension 
We parents original

Do amend   lies 
Why should Titania cross Oberon 
I beg little changeling boy
To henchman 

TITANIA
                   Set heart at rest 
The fairy-land buys child 
His mother was vot'ress order 
And  spiced Indian air  night 
Full often hath gossip'd side 
And sat Neptune's yellow sands 
Marking embarked traders flood 
When laugh'd see sails conceive 
And grow big-bellied wanton wind 
Which  pretty swimming gait
Following  womb rich young squire  
Would imitate  sail upon land 
To fetch trifles  return again 
As voyage  rich merchandise 
But  being mortal  boy die 
And sake rear boy 
And sake part him 

OBERON
How long within wood intend stay 

TITANIA
Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day 
If patiently dance our round 
And see our moonlight revels  
If  shun  spare haunts

We chide downright longer stay 

 Exit TITANIA Train  

OBERON
Well  way  shalt grove
Till torment injury  
My gentle Puck  come hither  remember'st
Since once sat upon promontory 
And heard mermaid  dolphin's back 
Uttering dulcet harmonious breath 
That rude sea grew civil at song 
And certain stars shot madly spheres
To hear sea-maid's music 

PUCK
                              remember 

OBERON
That very time saw  couldst  
Flying between cold moon earth 
Cupid  arm'd  certain aim took
At fair vestal  throned west 
And loos'd love-shaft smartly bow 
As should pierce hundred thousand hearts 
But might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
Quench'd chaste beams watery moon 
And imperial votaress passed 
In maiden meditation  fancy-free 
Yet mark'd where bolt Cupid fell 
It fell upon little western flower  
Before milk-white  purple love's wound  
And maidens call love-in-idleness 
Fetch flower  herb showed once 
The juice sleeping eyelids laid
Will make man woman madly dote
Upon next live creature sees 
Fetch herb  here again
Ere leviathan can swim league

In forty minutes 

 Exit PUCK

And drop liquor eyes

Be lion  bear  wolf  bull 
On meddling monkey  busy ape  
She pursue soul love 
And ere take charm off sight  
As can take another herb

Makes speed catch tiger  bootless speed 
When cowardice pursues valour flies

Where ox-lips nodding violet grows 
Quite over-canopied luscious woodbine 
With sweet musk-roses  eglantine 
There sleeps Titania sometime night 
Lulled these flowers dances delight 
And there snake throws enamell'd skin 
Weed wide enough wrap fairy 
And juice streak eyes 
And make full hateful fantasies 
Take some  seek through grove 
A sweet Athenian lady love
With disdainful youth  anoint eyes 
But when next thing espies
May lady  shalt know man
By Athenian garments hath 
Effect some care  may prove
More fond than upon love 
And look meet ere first cock crow

Nay  good Lysander  sake  dear 
Lie farther off  lie near 

LYSANDER
O  take sense  sweet  innocence 
Love takes meaning love's conference 
I mean heart unto yours knit 
So heart can make 
Two bosoms interchained oath 
So two bosoms single troth 
Then side bed-room deny 
For lying  Hermia  lie 

HERMIA
Lysander riddles very prettily  
Now much beshrew manners pride
If Hermia meant say Lysander lied 
But  gentle friend  love courtesy
Lie further off  human modesty 
Such separation may said
Becomes virtuous bachelor maid 
So far distant  good night  sweet friend 
Thy love ne'er alter till sweet life end

Amen  amen  fair prayer say 
And end life when end loyalty

O  out breath fond chase 
The more prayer  lesser grace 
Happy Hermia  wheresoe'er lies 
For hath blessed attractive eyes 
How came eyes bright  salt tears 
If  eyes oftener wash'd than hers 
No   ugly bear 
For beasts meet run away fear 
Therefore marvel though Demetrius
Do  monster  fly presence 
What wicked dissembling glass mine
Made compare Hermia's sphery eyne  
But who here  Lysander  ground 
Dead  asleep  see blood  wound

The tedious minutes spent 
Not Hermia Helena love 
Who change raven dove 
The man reason sway'd 
And reason says worthier maid 
Things growing ripe until season 
So  being young  till ripe reason 
And touching point human skill 
Reason becomes marshal 
And leads eyes  where o'erlook
Love's stories  written love's richest book 

HELENA
Wherefore was keen mockery born 
When at hands deserve scorn 
Is't enough  is't enough  young man 
That never   never can
Deserve sweet look Demetrius' eye 
But must flout insufficiency 
Good troth  wrong  good sooth  
In disdainful manner woo 
But fare  perforce must confess 
I thought lord more true gentleness 
O  lady man refus'd
Should another therefore abus'd 

 Exit  

LYSANDER
She sees Hermia  Hermia  sleep there 
And never mayst come Lysander near 
For  surfeit sweetest things
The deepest loathing stomach brings 
Or  heresies men leave
Are hated most those deceive 
So  surfeit heresy 
Of hated  most 
And  powers  address love might
To honour Helen  knight

To pluck crawling serpent breast 
Ay  pity  dream was here

Methought serpent eat heart away 
And sat smiling at cruel prey

What  out hearing  gone  sound  word 
Alack  where  speak  hear 
Speak  loves  swoon almost fear 
No  perceive nigh 
Either death find immediately

 Enter PUCK  

Here comes messenger   mad spirit 
What night-rule about haunted grove 

PUCK
My mistress monster love 
Near close consecrated bower 
While was dull sleeping hour 
A crew patches  rude mechanicals 
That work bread upon Athenian stalls 
Were met together rehearse play
Intended great Theseus' nuptial day 
The shallowest thickskin barren sort
Who Pyramus presented sport 
Forsook scene enter'd brake 
When him at advantage take 
An ass's nowl fix&egrave d head 
Anon  Thisbe must answered 
And forth mimic comes  When him spy 
As wild geese creeping fowler eye 
Or russet-pated choughs  many sort 
Rising cawing at gun's report 
Sever themselves madly sweep sky 
So at sight away fellows fly 
And at our stamp here  o'er o'er falls 
He murder cries  help Athens calls 
Their sense weak  lost fears  strong 
Made senseless things begin wrong 
For briers thorns at apparel snatch 
Some sleeves  some hats  yielders things catch 
I led distracted fear 
And left sweet Pyramus translated there 
When moment  came pass  
Titania wak'd  straightway lov'd ass 

OBERON
This falls out better than could devise 
But hast latch'd Athenian's eyes
With love-juice  bid do

O  rebuke him loves so 
Lay breath bitter bitter foe 

HERMIA
Now chide  should use worse 
For  fear  hast given cause curse 
If hast slain Lysander sleep 
Being o'er shoes blood  plunge deep 
And kill too 
The sun was true unto day
As  would stol'n away
From sleeping Hermia  believe soon
This whole earth may bor'd  moon
May through centre creep displease
Her brother's noontide antipodes 
It cannot hast murder'd him 
So should murderer look  dead  grim 

DEMETRIUS
So should murder'd look  should 
Pierc'd through heart stern cruelty 
Yet  murderer  look bright  clear 
As yonder Venus glimmering sphere 

HERMIA
What's Lysander  where 
Ah  good Demetrius  wilt give him 

DEMETRIUS
I had rather give carcass hounds 

HERMIA
Out  dog  out  cur  driv'st past bounds
Of maiden's patience  Hast slain him  
Henceforth never number'd among men 
Oh  once tell true  tell true  even sake 
Durst look'd upon him  being awake 
And hast kill'd him sleeping  brave touch 
Could worm  adder  much 
An adder  doubler tongue
Than thine  serpent  never adder stung 

DEMETRIUS
You spend passion mispris'd mood 
I guilty Lysander's blood 
Nor dead  aught can tell 

HERMIA
I pray  tell   

DEMETRIUS
An could  should get therefore 

HERMIA
A privilege never see more  
And hated presence part 
See more whether dead 

 Exit  

DEMETRIUS
There following fierce vein 
Here  therefore  while remain 
So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
For debt bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe 
Which some slight measure pay 
If tender here make some stay 

 Lies down  

OBERON
What hast done  hast mistaken quite 
And laid love-juice some true-love's sight 
Of misprision must perforce ensue
Some true love turn'd  false turn'd true

Then fate o'er-rules   man holding troth 
A million fail  confounding oath oath

All fancy-sick  pale cheer 
With sighs love  costs fresh blood dear 
By some illusion see bring here

 Enter LYSANDER HELENA  

LYSANDER
Why should think should woo scorn 
  Scorn derision never come tears 
Look when vow  weep  vows born 
  nativity truth appears 
How can these things seem scorn 
Bearing badge faith  prove true 

HELENA
You advance cunning more more 
  When truth kills truth  devilish-holy fray 
These vows Hermia's  give o'er 
  Weigh oath oath  nothing weigh 
Your vows  put two scales 
Will even weigh  both light tales 

LYSANDER
I had judgment when swore 

HELENA
Nor none  mind  give o'er 

LYSANDER
Demetrius loves  loves 

DEMETRIUS
 Awaking  
O Helen  goddess  nymph  perfect  divine 
To  love  compare thine eyne 
Crystal muddy   ripe show
Thy lips  those kissing cherries  tempting grow 
That pure congealed white  high Taurus' snow 
Fann'd eastern wind  turns crow
When hold'st hand   kiss
This princess pure white  seal bliss 

HELENA
O spite  hell  see bent
To set against merriment 
If were civil  knew courtesy 
You would much injury 
Can hate  know 
But must join souls mock too 
If were men  men show 
You would use gentle lady 
To vow  swear  superpraise parts 
When sure hate hearts 
You both rivals  love Hermia 
And both rivals  mock Helena 
A trim exploit  manly enterprise 
To conjure tears poor maid's eyes
With derision  None noble sort
Would offend virgin  extort
A poor soul's patience  make sport 

LYSANDER
You unkind  Demetrius  
For love Hermia  know know 
And here  good  heart 
In Hermia's love yield part 
And yours Helena bequeath 
Whom love till death 

HELENA
Never mockers waste more idle breath 

DEMETRIUS
Lysander  keep Hermia  none 
If e'er lov'd  love gone 
My heart guest-wise sojourn'd 
And Helen home return'd 
There remain 

LYSANDER

DEMETRIUS
Disparage faith dost know 
Lest  peril  aby dear  
Look where love comes  yonder dear 

 Enter HERMIA  

HERMIA
Dark night  eye function takes 
The ear more quick apprehension makes 
Wherein doth impair seeing sense 
It pays hearing double recompense  
Thou art mine eye  Lysander  found 
Mine ear  thank  brought sound 
But unkindly didst leave so 

LYSANDER
Why should stay whom love doth press 

HERMIA
What love could press Lysander side 

LYSANDER
Lysander's love  would him bide  
Fair Helena  who more engilds night
Than yon fiery oes eyes light 
Why seek'st  could make know
The hate bare made leave so 

HERMIA
You speak think  cannot 

HELENA
Lo  confederacy 
Now perceive conjoin'd three
To fashion false sport spite 
Injurious Hermia  most ungrateful maid 
Have conspir'd  these contriv'd 
To bait foul derision 
Is counsel two shar'd 
The sisters' vows  hours spent 
When chid hasty-footed time
For parting   forgot 
All school-days' friendship  childhood innocence 
We  Hermia  two artificial gods 
Have our needles created both flower 
Both sampler  sitting cushion 
Both warbling song  both key 
As our hands  our sides  voices  minds 
Had been incorporate  grew together 
Like double cherry  seeming parted 
But union partition 
Two lovely berries moulded stem 
So  two seeming bodies  heart 
Two first  coats heraldry 
Due  crowned crest 
And rent our ancient love asunder 
To join men scorning poor friend 
It friendly  'tis maidenly 
Our sex   may chide 
Though alone feel injury 

HERMIA
I amazed at passionate words 
I scorn  seems scorn 

HELENA
Have set Lysander  scorn 
To follow  praise eyes face 
And made other love  Demetrius  
Who even spurn foot  
To call goddess  nymph  divine  rare 
Precious  celestial  Wherefore speaks this
To hates  wherefore doth Lysander
Deny love  rich within soul 
And tender  forsooth  affection 
But setting  consent 
What though grace 
So hung upon love  fortunate 
But miserable most  love unlov'd 
This should pity rather than despise 

HERMIA
I understand mean 

HELENA
Ay  persever  counterfeit sad looks 
Make mows upon when turn back 
Wink each at other  hold sweet jest 
This sport  carried  chronicled 
If any pity  grace  manners 
You would make argument 
But fare  'tis partly own fault 
Which death  absence  soon remedy 

LYSANDER
Stay  gentle Helena  hear excuse 
My love  life  soul  fair Helena 

HELENA
O excellent 

HERMIA
             Sweet  scorn 

DEMETRIUS
If cannot entreat  can compel 

LYSANDER
Thou canst compel more than entreat 
Thy threats more strength than weak prayers  
Helen  love  life 
I swear which lose thee
To prove him false says love 

DEMETRIUS
I say love more than can 

LYSANDER
If say  withdraw  prove too 

DEMETRIUS
Quick  come  

HERMIA

Seem break loose  take would follow 
But come  tame man

Out  loathed medicine  hated potion  hence

LYSANDER
Demetrius  keep word 

DEMETRIUS
I would had bond  perceive
A weak bond holds  trust word 

LYSANDER
What  should hurt  strike  kill dead 
Although hate  harm 

HERMIA
What  can greater harm than hate 
Hate  wherefore   news  love 
Am Hermia  Lysander 
I fair was erewhile 
Since night lov'd  since night left 
Why  left   gods forbid  
In earnest  say 

LYSANDER
                          life 
And never desire see more 
Therefore out hope  question  doubt 
Be certain  nothing truer  'tis jest
That hate love Helena

O  juggler  cankerblossom 
You thief love   come night 
And stol'n love's heart him

Have modesty  maiden shame 
No touch bashfulness   tear
Impatient answers gentle tongue 
Fie  fie  counterfeit  puppet  

HERMIA
Puppet  so   way goes game 
Now perceive hath made compare
Between our statures  hath urg'd height 
And personage  tall personage 
Her height  forsooth  hath prevail'd him  
And grown high esteem
Because dwarfish low 
How low  painted maypole  speak 
How low  low
But nails can reach unto thine eyes 

HELENA
I pray  though mock  gentlemen 
Let hurt  was never curst 
I gift at shrewishness 
I right maid cowardice 
Let strike  perhaps may think 
Because something lower than myself 
That can match 

HERMIA
                      Lower  hark  again 

HELENA
Good Hermia  bitter 
I evermore love  Hermia 
Did ever keep counsels  never wrong'd 
Save  love unto Demetrius 
I told him stealth unto wood 
He follow'd  love follow'd him 
But hath chid hence  threaten'd me
To strike  spurn  nay  kill too 
And  quiet 
To Athens bear folly back 
And follow farther  
You see simple fond 

HERMIA
Why  get gone  who is't hinders 

HELENA
A foolish heart leave here behind 

HERMIA

Be afraid  harm  Helena 

DEMETRIUS
No    though take part 

HELENA
O  when she's angry  keen shrewd 
She was vixen when went school 
And  though little  fierce 

HERMIA
Little again  nothing low little  
Why suffer flout thus 
Let come 

LYSANDER
                    Get gone  dwarf

Hie therefore  Robin  overcast night 
The starry welkin cover anon
With drooping fog  black Acheron 
And lead these testy rivals astray
As come within another's way 
Like Lysander sometime frame tongue 
Then stir Demetrius bitter wrong 
And sometime rail Demetrius 
And each other look lead 
Till o'er brows death-counterfeiting sleep
With leaden legs batty wings doth creep 
Then crush herb into Lysander's eye 
Whose liquor hath virtuous property 
To take thence error might
And make eyeballs roll wonted sight 
When next wake  derision
Shall seem dream fruitless vision 
And back Athens lovers wend
With league whose date till death never end 
Whiles affair employ 
I'll queen  beg Indian boy 
And charmed eye release
From monster's view  things peace

For night's swift dragons cut clouds full fast 
And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger 
At whose approach ghosts  wandering here there 
Troop home churchyards  damned spirits 
That cross-ways floods burial 
Already wormy beds gone 
For fear lest day should look shames upon
They wilfully exile themselves light 
And must aye consort black-brow'd night

Opening Neptune fair blessed beams

One sees more devils than vast hell can hold

The poet's eye  fine frenzy rolling 
Doth glance heaven earth  earth heaven 
And imagination bodies forth
The forms things unknown  poet's pen
Turns shapes  gives airy nothing

Such tricks hath strong imagination

It comprehends some bringer joy 
Or night  imagining some fear

In nightly revels new jollity 

 Exeunt
